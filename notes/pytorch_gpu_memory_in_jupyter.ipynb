    "## Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python's [garbage collector](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html) is the mechanism used in Python to determine when a variable (and the corresponding memory) can be freed. A reference count mechanism is used to keep track of references to memory. Sometimes, reference count increases can go unnoticed and create issues since the garbage collector does not free the memory as expected.\n",
    "2. A common error is storing references to Pytorch-related variables attached to computation graphs (as described [here](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/memory-leak-from-unowned-inference/189575/2)). This will cause the computation graph to stay in memory and eventually trigger OOM errors or slow down processing due to inefficient memory management.\n",
    "3. A key pattern to avoid many of these errors is using context managers, which automatically handle reference counting and ensure that variables declared within the context are freed when the context is exited.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with torch.cuda.device(0):\n",
    "    # Code\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Functions and exception blocks (`try-except-finally`) also serve this purpose and it is often a good idea to combine them in functions that perform heavy processing tasks which might be interrupted. Interruptions, if not handled properly, may also interfere with the reference counting mechanism. The following is a useful snippet\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def func(params):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "\t\t# Heavy processing here\n",
    "    except: # Use specific exception if expected\n",
    "\t\ttorch.cuda.empty_cache() # Ensure cached memory is freed if exception triggers\n",
    "```"
