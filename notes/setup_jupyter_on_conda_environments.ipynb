    "## Accessing multiple environments from Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years I have faced many times the task of setting up several virtual environments that would be used from Jupyter notebooks. Initially I resorted to the \"simple\" but pretty horrible idea of installing Jupyter in every virtual environment. This quickly leads to friction since using a different virtual environment required starting a different Jupyter server which is tedious.\n",
    "\n",
    "My current approach is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Jupyter Lab  and the `nb_conda_kernels` extension in the base environment\n",
    "2. Add `ipykernel` to any environment I want accessible in Jupyter\n",
    "3. Start Jupyter from the base environment, create a notebook, and select the desired virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "I have found no downside with this setup, other than having to install `nb_conda_kernels` extension in the `base` environment and `ipykernel` in each virtual environment, which is no effort compared to the mess of having a separate Jupyter in each virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also install additional packages such as `jupyter_contrib_extensions` and `jupyterlab_widgets`, which I use in most of my projects."
