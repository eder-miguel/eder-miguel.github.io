    "1. We run Jupyter in the remote machine using `--no-browser` so that no browser is opened in the remote machine.\n",
    "2. Any available port can be specified to avoid port collisions.\n",
    "3. The `-Nf` options for the SSH tunnel run the SSH session in the background (`-f`) without executing remote commands (`-N`).\n",
    "4. The item `localhost:[port_in_local]:localhost:[port_in_remote]` can be split in two parts. The first `localhost:[port_in_local]` specifies the local address (the address on the local machine where the port is being opened), in this case `localhost`, indicating that only the local machine can access that port, and the local port, `[port_in_local]`, where the tunnel will listen. The second `localhost:[port_in_remote]` indicates the address on the remote machine to connect to, here `localhost`, meaning that SSH will connect to a service running on the local machine, and `[port_in_remote]`, which specifies the port in the remote machine to which the tunnel connects.\n",
    "5. In order to access the remote Jupyter server, we access the local port of the SSH tunnel via `http://localhost:[port_in_local]`.\n"
