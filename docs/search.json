    "text": "About Me\nHi, I’m Eder Miguel.\nI enjoy exploring computational solutions to practical problems and am always looking for opportunities to learn something new. I currently work as a Research Software Engineer at IST Austria, where I focus on developing tools for super-resolution light microscopy. This includes tasks like image and volume segmentation, stitching large microscopy datasets, and analyzing data to help biologists and neuroscientists make sense of their results.\nBefore this, I worked on physics-based simulations, particularly data-driven methods for fabric mechanics and computational design tools. Along the way, I’ve also explored topics like soft robotics, neural rendering, contact simulation, and real-time hand interaction simulations.\nI obtained my PhD in Computer Graphics in 2014. Afterwards, I was a postdoctoral researcher at IST Austria and in 2017, I co-founded Desilico Labs (now Seddi), a startup focused on fabric simulation and digitalization. In 2020, I returned to IST Austria, as a research engineer. During my time here, I took a brief break to work at Meta Zurich for a few months, before returning to my current role.\nOutside of work, I like to experiment with new ideas and side projects. This blog is a place to share some of that exploration, or simply things I find interesting.\n\n\nWhy This Blog?\nStarting this blog has been on my mind for years, but for one reason or another, it kept getting postponed.\nNow feels like the right time.\nMy goal is to share posts —whether long or short— about experiments, projects, useful resources, or ideas I find worth documenting and sharing.\n\nThanks for visiting!"
