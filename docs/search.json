    "text": "Breakdown\n\nAs an alternative, one could install a separate Jupyter instance on each virtual environment. In my experience it is tedious and error prone. For me the approach above works best.\nThe nb_conda_kernels extension enables access to individual virtual environments from the Jupyter instance installed in the base environent.\nAdding ipykernel allows the virtual environment to be accessible by Jupyter.\nJupyter is always started in the base environment. Then, each individual notebook will use one of the installed environments.\nI also install additional packages such as jupyter_contrib_extensions and jupyterlab_widgets, which I use in most of my projects."

    "text": "About Me\nHi, I’m Eder Miguel.\nI enjoy exploring computational solutions to practical problems and am always looking for opportunities to learn something new. I currently work as a Research Software Engineer at IST Austria, where I focus on developing tools for super-resolution light microscopy. This includes tasks like image and volume segmentation, stitching large microscopy datasets, and analyzing data to help biologists and neuroscientists make sense of their results.\nBefore this, I worked on physics-based simulations, particularly data-driven methods for fabric mechanics and computational design tools. Along the way, I’ve also explored topics like soft robotics, neural rendering, contact simulation, and real-time hand interaction simulations.\nI obtained my PhD in Computer Graphics in 2014. Afterwards, I was a postdoctoral researcher at IST Austria and in 2017, I co-founded Desilico Labs (now Seddi), a startup focused on fabric simulation and digitalization. In 2020, I returned to IST Austria, as a research engineer. During my time here, I took a brief break to work at Meta Zurich for a few months, before returning to my current role.\nOutside of work, I like to experiment with new ideas and side projects. This blog is a place to share some of that exploration, or simply things I find interesting.\n\n\nWhy This Blog?\nStarting this blog has been on my mind for years, but for one reason or another, it kept getting postponed.\nNow feels like the right time.\nMy goal is to share posts —whether long or short— about experiments, projects, useful resources, or ideas I find worth documenting and sharing.\n\nThanks for visiting!"

The first localhost:[port_in_local] specifies the local address (the address on the local machine where the port is being opened), in this case localhost, indicating that only the local machine can access that port, and the local port, [port_in_local], where the tunnel will listen. The second localhost:[port_in_remote] indicates the address on the remote machine to connect to, here localhost, meaning that SSH will connect to a service running on the local machine, and [port_in_remote], which specifies the port in the remote machine to which the tunnel connects.\nIn order to access the remote Jupyter server, we access the local port of the SSH tunnel via http://localhost:[port_in_local]."
