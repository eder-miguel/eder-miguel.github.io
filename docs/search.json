    "text": "About Me\nHi, I’m Eder Miguel.\nI enjoy exploring computational solutions to practical problems and am always looking for opportunities to learn something new. I currently work as a Research Software Engineer at IST Austria, where I focus on developing tools for super-resolution light microscopy. This includes tasks like image and volume segmentation, stitching large microscopy datasets, and analyzing data to help biologists and neuroscientists make sense of their results.\nBefore this, I worked on physics-based simulations, particularly data-driven methods for fabric mechanics and computational design tools. Along the way, I’ve also explored topics like soft robotics, neural rendering, contact simulation, and real-time hand interaction simulations.\nI obtained my PhD in Computer Graphics in 2014. Afterwards, I was a postdoctoral researcher at IST Austria and in 2017, I co-founded Desilico Labs (now Seddi), a startup focused on fabric simulation and digitalization. In 2020, I returned to IST Austria, as a research engineer. During my time here, I took a brief break to work at Meta Zurich for a few months, before returning to my current role.\nOutside of work, I like to experiment with new ideas and side projects. This blog is a place to share some of that exploration, or simply things I find interesting.\n\n\nWhy This Blog?\nStarting this blog has been on my mind for years, but for one reason or another, it kept getting postponed.\nNow feels like the right time.\nMy goal is to share posts —whether long or short— about experiments, projects, useful resources, or ideas I find worth documenting and sharing.\n\nThanks for visiting!"

    "text": "Accessing multiple environments from Jupyter\nOver the years I have faced many times the task of setting up several virtual environments that would be used from Jupyter notebooks. Initially I resorted to the “simple” but pretty horrible idea of installing Jupyter in every virtual environment. This quickly leads to friction since using a different virtual environment required starting a different Jupyter server which is tedious.\nMy current approach is:\n\nInstall Jupyter Lab and the nb_conda_kernels extension in the base environment\nAdd ipykernel to any environment I want accessible in Jupyter\nStart Jupyter from the base environment, create a notebook, and select the desired virtual environment\n\nI have found no downside with this setup, other than having to install nb_conda_kernels extension in the base environment and ipykernel in each virtual environment, which is no effort compared to the mess of having a separate Jupyter in each virtual environment.\nI also install additional packages such as jupyter_contrib_extensions and jupyterlab_widgets, which I use in most of my projects.\n\nLinks\n\nnb_conda_kernels here\nipykernel here\nPost where I found out about this approach first"
